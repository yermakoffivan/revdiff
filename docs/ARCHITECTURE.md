## Package Responsibilities

### app/revdiff/ (composition root)

`package main` is the composition root, split across files by concern:

- **`main.go`** — `main()`, early-exit commands (version, dump-config, dump-keys), `run()`
  orchestration, `finalize()` (history safety-net vs `-o` handoff after `p.Run()`)
- **`config.go`** — `options` struct, `parseArgs`, `dumpConfig`, `loadConfigFile`, config-path
  helpers
- **`stdin.go`** — stdin validation, `/dev/tty` reopen, stdin renderer prep
- **`renderer_setup.go`** — `DetectVCS` wiring, `setupVCSRenderer` (git/hg/jj/no-VCS/all-files)
- **`themes.go`** — theme CLI commands (`--init-themes`, `--install-theme`, `--list-themes`,
  `--theme`), `applyTheme()`, `themeCatalog` adapter (composes `theme.Catalog` + config persistence
  for `ui.ThemeCatalog` interface)
- **`history_save.go`** — `histReq` struct and `saveHistory`
- **`signal.go`** — `shutdownGuard` (turns SIGHUP/SIGTERM into a single graceful `Quit` + a
  `wasSignaled` flag; SIGINT is caught and drained so a Ctrl-C during an external `$EDITOR` does not
  quit revdiff) and the consumer-side `quitter` interface

Key wiring pattern — all concrete types constructed here, injected into `ui.Model` through
interfaces and factory closures:

```go
ModelConfig{
    Renderer:      diffRenderer,           // diff.Git, diff.Hg, etc.
    Highlighter:   highlighter,            // highlight.Highlighter
    StyleResolver: styleResolver,          // style.Resolver
    StyleRenderer: styleRenderer,          // style.Renderer
    SGR:           sgr,                    // style.SGR
    WordDiffer:    &worddiff.Differ{},
    Overlay:       overlay.NewManager(...),
    Themes:        themes,                 // themeCatalog adapter
    NewFileTree:   func(...) FileTreeComponent { ... },
    ParseTOC:      func(...) TOCComponent { ... },
    // ...flags, store, keymap
}
```

### app/diff/ — VCS and diff parsing

Handles all interaction with version control systems and diff parsing.

**VCS detection** (`vcs.go`): `DetectVCS()` walks up directory tree looking for `.jj`/`.git`/`.hg`
markers, returns `VCSJJ`, `VCSGit`, `VCSHg`, or `VCSNone`. `.jj` is checked before `.git` so
colocated jj+git repositories resolve as jj (reads go through the jj working-copy model instead of
bypassing it via git).

**Renderer implementations** — all implement the `ui.Renderer` interface (`ChangedFiles()` +
`FileDiff()`). `FileDiff` takes a single `FileDiffRequest` value (`Ref`, `Path`, `OldPath`,
`Staged`, `ContextLines`) rather than positional args — bundled to stay under the 4-param limit and
to carry the rename origin:
- `Git` — runs `git diff`, parses unified diff output. Rename-aware: `ChangedFiles` keeps the rename
  origin on `FileEntry.OldPath`, and `FileDiff` passes `-M` plus both old/new paths (`pathArgs`) so
  git pairs the rename into a minimal diff instead of rendering the file as fully added. Untracked
  renames (plain `mv old new`, where `new` is untracked so `git diff -M` can't pair it) are
  recovered by `UntrackedRenames` off a throwaway index (`tempIndexWithIntentToAdd` copies
  `.git/index`, `git add -N` the untracked paths against the copy with `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, then
  `git diff -M` reports the pair); `FileDiff` renders them the same way via `untrackedRenameDiff`.
  Git-only — `Hg`/`Jj` never set `OldPath`, so they ignore it
- `Hg` — runs `hg diff --git`, parses unified diff output
- `Jj` — runs `jj diff --git`, parses unified diff output; git-style refs (HEAD, HEAD~N, A..B)
  translate to jj revsets via `--from`/`--to`. jj emits raw bytes for binary files, so
  `(*Jj).synthesizeBinaryDiff` rewrites such diffs with the git-style "Binary files … differ" marker
  so `parseUnifiedDiff` produces a binary placeholder.

**CommitLogger capability** (`CommitLog(ref string) ([]CommitInfo, error)`) — an additive capability
interface implemented by `Git`/`Hg`/`Jj` and consumed by the `i` info overlay. Separate from the
base `Renderer` so non-VCS renderers (`FileReader`, `DirectoryReader`, `StdinReader`) stay
unaffected. Each VCS translates the pre-combined ref string to its own log syntax (`X..HEAD` for
git, `X::.` for hg, `X..@` for jj), caps results at 500 commits, and strips raw `\x1b` bytes from
subject/body at parse time so the overlay can render without re-scanning for ANSI injection. Hg uses
ASCII US/RS separators (`\x1f`/`\x1e`) because literal NUL is invalid in argv; git and jj use
NUL/SOH via stdout.
- `FileReader` — reads standalone files as full-context (no VCS needed)
- `DirectoryReader` — lists all tracked files via a pluggable lister (`git ls-files` by default;
  `NewJjDirectoryReader` uses `jj file list`) for `--all-files` mode
- `StdinReader` — reads from stdin as scratch buffer
- `FallbackRenderer` — wraps a primary renderer with fallback for files not in diff
- `ExcludeFilter` / `IncludeFilter` — decorators for prefix-based file filtering

**Diff parsing** (`parseUnifiedDiff`): converts unified diff output into `[]DiffLine`. Each
`DiffLine` carries:
- `Content` — line text without `+`/`-` prefix (prefix re-added at render time)
- `Change` — `ChangeAdd`, `ChangeRemove`, `ChangeContext`, or `ChangeDivider`
- `OldNum` / `NewNum` — original and new line numbers (0 for non-applicable)

**Blame** (`blame.go`, `hgblame.go`, `jjblame.go`): `Blamer` interface provides `FileBlame()`
returning `map[int]BlameLine` keyed by new line number. jj blame uses
`jj file annotate -T <template>` with a tab-separated template.

### app/ui/ — TUI package

Central package. Single `Model` struct implements bubbletea's `Model` interface. Methods split
across files by concern to keep files under ~500 lines:

- **`model.go`** — Model struct, sub-state structs, `NewModel`, `Init`, `Update`, `handleKey`,
  interfaces
- **`view.go`** — `View()`, status bar rendering, ANSI helpers
- **`handlers.go`** — modal handlers (enter/esc, discard, filter, reviewed), help spec
- **`loaders.go`** — async file/blame loading, reviewed-fingerprint reconciliation, loaded-message
  handlers, data helpers
- **`diffview.go`** — diff line rendering, gutters, line styling, search highlights
- **`diffnav.go`** — cursor movement, hunk navigation, viewport sync, horizontal scroll
- **`scrollbar.go`** — vertical scrollbar thumb post-processing on rendered diff/tree/TOC panes
  (replaces right-border `│` with `┃` on rows mapped to the visible viewport portion)
- **`collapsed.go`** — collapsed diff mode: hide removes, show modified markers
- **`annotate.go`** — annotation input lifecycle (start, save, cancel, delete) and the visual-row
  chokepoint: `annotationVisualRows` is the single source of truth for "how many rows + what content
  does this annotation paint as." Memoized on `annot.rowCache`, invalidated by `handleFileLoaded`,
  `applyTheme`, and `cancelThemeSelect`
- **`annotlist.go`** — annotation list spec building, cross-file jump logic
  (`jumpToAnnotationTarget` for the `@` popup, `tryJumpToAnnotationTarget` returning a jumped-bool
  for the `}`/`{` walker)
- **`annotnav.go`** — cross-file annotation navigation (`}` / `{`): builds the flat annotation list,
  computes adjacent target via exact-match or insertion-point fallback, retries through non-jumpable
  targets so a hidden annotation cannot trap the walker
- **`editor.go`** — `$EDITOR` handoffs for annotation temp-file editing and source-file opening:
  `openEditor()` / `openSourceEditor()` wrap `app/editor.Editor` in `tea.ExecProcess`, capture
  target state, route completion, and refresh the current file after a clean source-editor exit
- **`output.go`** — in-session annotation flush and optional post-flush command handoff through
  injected `PostFlushHook` + `tea.ExecProcess`
- **`themeselect.go`** — theme selector operations: open, preview, confirm, apply (via injected
  `ThemeCatalog`)
- **`filepicker.go`** — file picker open and selected-path jump integration; delegates
  visible-order/filter ownership to `FileTreeComponent` and loading to the guarded file loader
- **`search.go`** — search input handling, match computation, navigation
- **`mouse.go`** — mouse event routing: `handleMouse` dispatch, `hitTest` pane classification
  (`hitZone`), wheel/left-click helpers (`clickTree`, `clickDiff`), layout helpers
  (`statusBarHeight`, `diffTopRow`, `treeTopRow`). Diff-pane wheel events defer both the cursor pin
  and the `SetContent(renderDiff())` call via a single in-flight `tea.Tick(wheelRenderDelay)`
  debounce (issue #179) — `wheelState.tickInFlight` ensures one tick at a time across an entire
  burst (subsequent wheels just bump `gen`); stale ticks reschedule, matching ticks flush.
  `flushWheelPending()` is called from `handleWheelDebounce`, `handleKey`, `handleResize`, and
  `handleBlameLoaded` (any path that runs `syncViewportToCursor` or reads `m.nav.diffCursor` must
  flush first). Mouse tracking is enabled program-wide via `tea.WithMouseCellMotion()` in
  `app/revdiff/main.go` unless `--no-mouse` / `REVDIFF_NO_MOUSE` is set

Each source file has a matching `_test.go`.

**Model state grouping** — `Model` fields are organized into explicit sub-structs by concern:

- **`modelConfigState` (`m.cfg`)** — immutable session config: `ref`, `staged`, `only`, `noColors`,
  `tabSpaces`, etc.
- **`layoutState` (`m.layout`)** — viewport and pane geometry: `viewport`, `focus`, `treeHidden`,
  `width`, `height`, `scrollX`
- **`loadedFileState` (`m.file`)** — current file's loaded state: `lines`, `highlighted`,
  `intraRanges`, `blameData`, `mdTOC`, `singleFile`
- **`modeState` (`m.modes`)** — user-togglable view modes: `wrap`, `collapsed`, `compact`,
  `compactContext`, `lineNumbers`, `wordDiff`, `showBlame`
- **`navigationState` (`m.nav`)** — cursor position: `diffCursor`, `pendingHunkJump`
- **`searchState` (`m.search`)** — search lifecycle: `active`, `term`, `matches`, `cursor`, `input`,
  `matchSet`, `history`, `historyIdx`
- **`annotationState` (`m.annot`)** — annotation input lifecycle and visual-row cache: `annotating`,
  `fileAnnotating`, `cursorOnAnnotation`, `input`, `rowCache`
- **`wheelState` (`m.wheel`)** — diff-pane wheel coalescing (issue #179): `gen`, `renderPending`,
  `tickInFlight`

Methods remain on `Model` — the sub-structs group mutable state for clarity, not to create
mini-models.

**Theme boundary** — `app/ui` does not import `app/theme` or `app/fsutil`. Theme discovery and
persistence are accessed through the `ThemeCatalog` interface (defined in `model.go`), with a
concrete adapter wired in `app/revdiff/themes.go`.

### app/ui/style/ — color, style resolution, and display helpers

Owns all hex-to-ANSI conversion, lipgloss style construction, SGR state tracking, HSL color math,
and semantic color accessors, plus the shared filename-display helpers every path-rendering surface
routes through.

Three main types:
- **`Resolver`** — static and runtime style/color lookups. Methods: `Color()`, `Style()`,
  `LineBg()`, `LineStyle()`, `WordDiffBg()`, `IndicatorBg()`
- **`Renderer`** — compound ANSI rendering for elements that need raw ANSI (not lipgloss). Methods:
  `AnnotationInline()`, `DiffCursor()`, `StatusBarSeparator()`, `FileStatusMark()`,
  `FileReviewedMark()`, `FileAnnotationMark()`
- **`SGR`** — ANSI SGR stream processor. `Reemit()` re-prepends active fg/bg/bold/italic state at
  continuation line starts (needed for wrap mode because `ansi.Wrap` doesn't preserve SGR across
  newlines)

`display.go` holds two package-level functions rather than methods on those types:
`SanitizeFilenameForDisplay()` strips control, ANSI/OSC, and bidi sequences out of
repository-supplied filenames, and `TruncateLeftToWidth()` left-truncates with an ellipsis. Both are
shared by the diff-pane header, the status bar, and the file picker; any new filename-rendering
surface must route through them.

### app/ui/sidepane/ — left-pane navigation

Two independent component types, both with cursor/offset management, rendering, and keyboard
navigation:
- **`FileTree`** — file tree sidebar. Supports navigation (`Move`/`StepFile`), filtering
  (annotated-only), semantic-fingerprint reviewed tracking, directory grouping. File-list reloads
  revalidate only paths reviewed before the load; marks added during the load are reconciled when
  that file's refreshed diff arrives. `VisibleFiles()` exposes file paths in rendered order after
  active filters for consumers such as the file picker.
- **`TOC`** — markdown table-of-contents. Activated for single-file full-context markdown. Active
  section tracking, header-level navigation

Both constructed via factory closures in `main.go`, consumed through
`FileTreeComponent`/`TOCComponent` interfaces.

### app/ui/overlay/ — popup layers

Layered popup system with mutual exclusivity (one overlay at a time).

- **`Manager`** — coordinator. Routes key events, manages open/close lifecycle, `Compose()` renders
  popup on top of background using ANSI-aware compositing (`overlayCenter()`)
- **`helpOverlay`** — scrollable keybinding help popup. Clamps to `term_w - 4` × `term_h - 4` (issue
  #304 — it previously sized to its content and got clipped on all four sides). Prefers two columns
  because they roughly halve the height, and falls back to a single column when the two-column form
  is wider than the terminal allows; anything still too wide after that is truncated. A body taller
  than the viewport scrolls (`j`/`k`, page/half-page, `Home`/`End`, `g`/`G`, wheel) and spends its
  last row on a muted `↑/↓ scroll · N-M of T` hint — the only cue that sections exist past the fold.
  That hint row is why `pageSize()` exists: paging must step by the last rendered viewport height,
  not by `usableHeight()`, or every page boundary skips the row the hint displaced. Rows are padded
  to the width of the whole body rather than of the visible slice, so the box does not resize while
  scrolling
- **`annotListOverlay`** — scrollable annotation list with cross-file jump
- **`themeSelectOverlay`** — theme picker with fzf-style filter, live swatch preview
- **`filePickerOverlay`** — type-to-filter visible-file picker with current-file positioning,
  arrow-key navigation, mouse selection, and basename-preserving path truncation
- **`infoOverlay`** (`info.go`) — unified info popup (description + session details + commit log).
  Description prose comes from `--description` / `--description-file`, sanitized to strip
  ANSI/control bytes, then highlighted via the markdown chroma path once at `NewModel` time and
  cached on `reviewInfoState.descriptionHighlighted` (the description is static, so re-highlighting
  on every overlay refresh would just produce identical bytes). Session metadata (mode, scope,
  filters, file/status counts, aggregate `+/-`) lives in the popup's top/bottom borders; commit log
  shows subject + body of every commit in the current ref range. Commits are populated eagerly at
  startup via `loadCommits()` in parallel with `loadFiles()` under `tea.Batch`; re-fetched on `R`
  reload. `handleInfo` always opens the popup; if the user presses `i` before the fetch lands, the
  commits section renders an inline "loading commits…" placeholder which flips to the rendered list
  when `commitsLoadedMsg` arrives (`refreshInfoOverlay` pushes a fresh spec into the open overlay).
  Sized via `clamp(term_w * 0.9, 30, 90)` × `term_h - 4`, wraps body text at word boundaries using
  `ansi.Wrap` from `charmbracelet/x/ansi` (ANSI-aware, preserves inline escapes). Renders "no
  commits in range" centered for the empty-list case and a truncated, italicized one-liner for fetch
  errors (`infoErrMaxLen` caps total length to keep the popup bounded against megabyte stderr).

`Manager.HandleKey()` returns an `Outcome` — Model switches on `OutcomeKind` to perform side effects
(file jumps, theme apply/persist). This keeps overlay package free of Model dependencies.
`Manager.HandleMouse()` mirrors the same shape for wheel and click events:
`app/ui/mouse.go::handleOverlayMouse` delegates when an overlay is active so info and help scroll,
annotlist/themeselect move their cursors (themeselect emits `OutcomeThemePreview` to restyle the
background live). Left-click in annotlist selects the clicked row and emits
`OutcomeAnnotationChosen`; left-click in themeselect emits `OutcomeThemeConfirmed` on entry rows
(filter and blank separator are no-ops). Click hit-testing uses the last-composed popup bounds
recorded in `Manager.bounds` during `Compose()`; clicks outside the popup rectangle are swallowed so
accidental clicks don't dismiss the overlay.

The file picker follows the same outcome flow: wheel input moves its cursor, and left-click emits
`OutcomeFileChosen` for the selected path.

### app/ui/worddiff/ — intra-line diff engine

Single stateless type `Differ` grouping all word-diff algorithms:
- `PairLines()` — matches add/remove lines within hunks for comparison
- `ComputeIntraRanges()` — token-level LCS diff producing byte-offset ranges
- `InsertHighlightMarkers()` — ANSI-aware highlight insertion, shared by both word-diff and search
  highlighting

30% similarity gate discards ranges for dissimilar pairs. Cost is guarded by a budget on the LCS
table size (token count of one line times the other), with a byte pre-filter that keeps minified
input out of the tokenizer — line length alone is not the cost driver. Ranges are byte offsets on
tab-replaced content, aligning with `prepareLineContent` output.

### app/highlight/ — syntax highlighting

Chroma-based syntax highlighter. Produces foreground-only ANSI output (no backgrounds) so that diff
line backgrounds from the style system are preserved. Highlighted lines pre-computed once per file
load, stored parallel to `diffLines`.

### app/keymap/ — keybindings

~30 `Action` constants (e.g., `ActionDown`, `ActionQuit`). `Keymap` type maps key strings to
actions. Loaded from file (`map <key> <action>` / `unmap <key>` format) or defaults.

Handlers use `m.keymap.Resolve(msg.String())` instead of raw key strings. Modal text-entry keys
(annotation input, search input, confirm discard) stay hardcoded. Overlay key dispatch uses keymap
actions for j/k/up/down but keeps `enter` and `esc` hardcoded.

Two-stage chord bindings (kitty-style, e.g. `map ctrl+w>x mark_reviewed`) are supported with a
ctrl+/alt+ leader restriction. Storage is flat strings in `bindings` (`"ctrl+w>x" → Action`); a lazy
`chordPrefixCache` provides O(1) `IsChordLeader` lookups. `Load` resolves conflicts by dropping a
standalone whose key is also a chord leader. `ResolveChord` applies the same Latin layout-resolve
fallback as `Resolve` for the second-stage key. Chord dispatch lives in `app/ui` on `keyState`
(`handleChordSecond`, `clearPendingInputState`) and flows through the shared `dispatchAction` path
so chord-resolved actions share handlers with single-key actions.

Help overlay dynamically rendered from `m.keymap.HelpSections()`.

### app/theme/ — theme system

Catalog-centric API with two types: `Theme` (data + serialization) and `Catalog` (directory-aware
operations). Zero standalone functions — all logic lives as methods on `Theme` or `Catalog`.

**`Theme`** — color palette data with metadata. Methods: `Dump(io.Writer)` for serialization.

**`Catalog`** — theme discovery, loading, installation, and gallery access. Created via
`NewCatalog(themesDir)`. Public methods: `Entries`, `Load`, `Resolve`, `InitBundled`, `InitAll`,
`Install`, `PrintList`, `ActiveName`, `OptionalColorKeys`.

File layout:
- `theme.go` — `Theme` struct, `Dump`, package-level vars (`colorKeys`, `optionalColorKeys`)
- `catalog.go` — `Catalog` struct, `NewCatalog`, all catalog methods (discovery, loading,
  installation, gallery)

Bundled themes: revdiff, catppuccin-mocha, catppuccin-latte, dracula, gruvbox, nord, solarized-dark.
Community themes live in `themes/gallery/`.

23 color keys mapped via `colorFieldPtrs()` in `app/revdiff/themes.go` — single source of truth for color
key to struct field mapping.

### app/annotation/ — annotation store

In-memory store for annotations. Each `Annotation` has file, line, text, and optional `EndLine` for
hunk range headers (triggered when comment contains "hunk" keyword). Structured output formatting
for export. `FormatOutput` escapes body lines that start with `## ` (with trailing space, matching
the record-header form) by prefixing a single space so downstream parsers cannot confuse a comment
line for a new record header. Lines starting with `###` or `##` without a space are left unchanged.
`WriteFile(path)` formats once via `FormatOutput`, persists atomically by delegating to
`fsutil.AtomicWriteFile` (temp file + rename, mode 0o600), and returns the exact snapshot written
for the optional post-flush hook; it backs the in-session `O` flush. The exit-time file write calls
`fsutil.AtomicWriteFile` directly with the already-formatted output, so both paths share the same
atomic writer and a concurrent reader never sees a truncated file.

### app/editor/ — external editor invocation

Prepares external editor processes for annotation temp-file editing and source-file opening.
TUI-agnostic — the caller wraps the returned `*exec.Cmd` with bubbletea's `tea.ExecProcess` (or runs
it directly).

Single stateless type `Editor` bundling all behavior as methods (no standalone functions):
- `Command(content)` — writes content to a `revdiff-annot-*.md` temp file, resolves the editor
  (`$EDITOR` → `$VISUAL` → `vi`, whitespace-split so `code --wait` works), returns `*exec.Cmd` + a
  `complete(runErr) (string, error)` function. `complete` reads the file, removes it regardless of
  outcome, and preserves `runErr` — content is still returned alongside a non-nil `runErr` so
  callers can keep user work on soft editor failures.
- `SourceCommand(path string, line int)` — checks that the source path exists and is a regular file
  as part of preparing an editor command, resolves the same editor chain, and returns an editor
  command for the existing source file. Known editors receive line-navigation arguments: `vi`,
  `vim`, `nvim`, `nano`, `hx`, and `helix` use `+N`, while `code`, `code-insiders`, `codium`, and
  `cursor` use `--goto path:N`. Unknown editors receive only the file path.

Consumed by `app/ui` via the `ExternalEditor` interface (defined in `app/ui/editor.go`, consumer
side). The default wiring is `editor.Editor{}` injected through `ModelConfig.Editor`.

### app/handoff/ — post-flush command preparation

Prepares the user-configured shell command for an explicit `O` handoff. `New` returns nil for an
empty command; a constructed runner's `Prepare(content)` is infallible, supplies the exact
annotation snapshot on stdin, and suppresses stdout so commands such as `tee` do not overwrite the
TUI. stderr remains attached when `app/ui` runs the command through `tea.ExecProcess`, and a command
may write OSC 52 directly through `/dev/tty`. The optional `PostFlushHook` interface is defined on
the UI consumer side and wired at the composition root only when `--post-flush-command` is set. The
hook is an independent `O` export target; it does not require an output file.

### app/history/ — session auto-save

`Save(Params)` writes review session as markdown to `~/.config/revdiff/history/`. Includes header,
annotations, and git diff for annotated files.

On a signal-delivered exit (a SIGHUP from a dropped SSH/tmux client, or a SIGTERM) `finalize()` in
`main.go` invokes this save as a crash-recovery net and stops there — history only, never the `-o`
output. This is a deliberate semantic change: a signal-delivered SIGTERM no longer writes `-o`,
because a signal is not the deliberate handoff that `q`/`O` perform. The wiring lives at the
composition root — `shutdownGuard` in `app/revdiff/signal.go` plus `tea.WithoutSignalHandler()` so revdiff
owns SIGHUP/SIGTERM instead of bubbletea. SIGINT is caught and drained so a Ctrl-C during an
external `$EDITOR` does not quit revdiff. The guard is stopped (default signal disposition restored
for all three) before `finalize()` runs, so a slow or hung finalize (`saveHistory` shells out to
git) stays killable by a second signal.

## Key Interfaces

All consumer-side — defined in `app/ui/model.go`, not in implementor packages (exception:
`diff.Renderer` is a local mirror exported for moq generation). This is idiomatic Go: interfaces
belong to the consumer.

  in `app/revdiff/themes.go` (composes `theme.Catalog` + config persistence)
- **`ExternalEditor`** — `Command(content)` for annotation temp-file editing,
  `SourceCommand(path string, line int)` for opening source files; implemented by `editor.Editor`
  (default wiring via `ModelConfig.Editor`; stubbed in tests)
- **`PostFlushHook`** — `Prepare(content)`; implemented by `handoff.Runner` (optional wiring via
  `ModelConfig.PostFlushHook`)

## Data Flow

### Startup

```
main()  [main.go]
  → parseArgs()          [config.go] → config file + CLI flags + env vars
  → handleThemes()       [themes.go] → theme resolution, apply
  → run()                [main.go]
      → prepareStdinMode [stdin.go]  (if --stdin)
      → setupVCSRenderer [renderer_setup.go] (otherwise)
      → construct style, theme catalog adapter, all dependencies
      → ui.NewModel(ModelConfig{...})
      → tea.NewProgram(model, WithoutSignalHandler).Run()  [shutdownGuard owns SIGHUP/SIGTERM; SIGINT drained]
      → finalize()      [main.go] → saveHistory() on non-discarded, non-empty exit; -o output only on graceful (non-signal) exit
```

### File Loading (async)

```
Model.Init() → loadFiles cmd
            → Renderer.ChangedFiles() → filesLoadedMsg
            → handleFilesLoaded drops stale msg (seq mismatch), else m.filesLoaded = true
            → (on success) tree.Rebuild(entries)
            → auto-select first file → loadFileDiff cmd
            → Renderer.FileDiff() → fileLoadedMsg
            → highlight.HighlightLines() → highlightedLines
            → (optional) loadBlame cmd → blameLoadedMsg
```

`View()` is gated on two flags so the user never sees an empty two-pane layout during async
initialisation: it returns the literal `"loading..."` while `!m.ready` (before the first
`WindowSizeMsg`), then `"loading files..."` while `m.ready && !m.filesLoaded` (after resize, before
an accepted `filesLoadedMsg`). `filesLoaded` flips to true on every accepted `filesLoadedMsg`
(success or error), so the loading screen always exits once the current in-flight load returns.
Stale responses (`msg.seq != m.filesLoadSeq`, e.g. an older load still in flight after
`toggleUntracked` bumped the sequence) are dropped and do not flip the flag or rebuild the tree.

### Rendering Pipeline

```
diffLines + highlightedLines
  → renderDiff() dispatches by mode:
    ├── expanded: renderDiffLine() per line
    │     → prepareLineContent() (tab replacement)
    │     → styleDiffContent() (syntax-highlighted or plain, with line bg)
    │     → applyIntraLineHighlight() (word-diff ranges, if active)
    │     → highlightSearchMatches() (search bg overlay, if active)
    │     → lineNumGutter() (if line numbers on)
    │     → blameGutter() (if blame on)
    │     → applyHorizontalScroll() (if not wrapped)
    │     → extendLineBg() (pad to full width)
    │     → wrapContent() + sgr.Reemit() (if wrapped)
    │
    └── collapsed: renderCollapsedDiff()
          → skip removed lines
          → buildModifiedSet() for modify vs pure-add styling

  → viewport.SetContent()
  → View():
    ├── truncateHeaderTitle() (sanitize + left-truncate filename to 1 row)
    ├── lipgloss.JoinVertical(header, viewport.View())
    ├── padContentBg() (pre-render: pane bg fill on assembled content)
    ├── lipgloss.Render() with Border() + Width()/Height()
    └── applyScrollbar() (post-render: thumb glyph on diff right-border rows)

sidepane.Render() (file tree or markdown TOC)
  → padContentBg()
  → lipgloss.Render() with Border() + Width()/Height()
  → applyNavigationScrollbar() (post-render: thumb glyph on navigation right-border rows)
  → terminal
```

Each rendering feature (line numbers, blame, word-diff, search, wrap, collapsed) is orthogonal — can
be independently toggled.

### Annotation Flow

```
User presses 'a' on diff line
  → annotating = true, annotateInput focused
  → Enter → store.Add(file, line, text)  (single-line fast path)
  → Ctrl+E → openEditor()
      → editor.Editor.Command(seed)     (app/editor)
      → tea.ExecProcess(cmd, complete)  (suspends bubbletea, hands over tty)
      → editorFinishedMsg{content, err, target...}
      → handleEditorFinished:
          err != nil     → log, keep annotation mode open, preserve input
          content == ""  → cancelAnnotation (preserve existing annotation)
          otherwise      → saveComment(content, fileLevel, line, type)
  → re-render shows annotation (multi-line aware) below diff line
  → 'O' (flush_output, requires --output and/or PostFlushHook):
      → empty store: status hint, no export
      → optional store.WriteFile(path) → atomic file snapshot
      → optional PostFlushHook.Prepare(snapshot) → tea.ExecProcess → command reads snapshot from stdin
      → revdiff stays open (annotate → flush → hand off → 'R' reload loop)
  → on quit: store.FormatOutput() → structured output to stdout/file (file branch uses store.WriteFile)
  → (optional) history.Save() → markdown to ~/.config/revdiff/history/ (best-effort warnings only)
  → if --exit-code-on-annotations is enabled and output is non-empty: exit 10
```

### Source Editor Flow

```
User presses 'e' in diff pane
  → openSourceEditor()
      → sourceEditorTarget() chooses file path and optional worktree line
      → editor.Editor.SourceCommand(path, line) prepares the source-file command
      → tea.ExecProcess(cmd, complete)  (suspends bubbletea, hands over tty)
      → sourceEditorFinishedMsg{err, refreshPolicy}
      → handleSourceEditorFinished:
          err != nil  → log, show hint, do not reload
          err == nil and worktree refresh policy
              → reloadCurrentFile() reloads current file only
          err == nil and no-refresh policy
              → return to revdiff without reloading
```

Source line navigation is best effort for all worktree-backed reviews. Staged and ref reviews still
request the focused line when revdiff can derive one from the loaded diff, but clean editor exits
from staged and ref reviews do not reload the displayed diff. Removed rows target the nearest line
that still exists in the current file; when previous and next current-file rows are equally near,
the previous row wins.

### Overlay Flow

```
User presses '?' / '@' / 'T' / 'P' / 'i'
  → Model calls overlay.OpenHelp/OpenAnnotList/OpenThemeSelect/OpenFilePicker/OpenInfo
      (for 'i': review scope is assembled from ReviewInfoConfig and current
       file-load state; aggregate +/- stats are fetched lazily on first open
       via loadReviewStats() and pushed into the open popup with UpdateInfo().
       Commits are fetched eagerly at startup via loadCommits(), running in
       parallel with loadFiles() under tea.Batch from Init(); triggerReload()
       re-fires both together. handleCommitsLoaded caches the result under a
       seq-guard (m.commits.loadSeq) and refreshes the open popup. The info
       popup always opens; modes without a meaningful commit range hide the
       commits section instead of treating `i` as a no-op.)
  → overlay.Manager activates popup, blocks other overlays
  → key events route through Manager.HandleKey() → Outcome
  → Model switches on OutcomeKind:
      OutcomeAnnotationChosen → load target file, position cursor
      OutcomeThemePreview → preview theme colors, update resolver
      OutcomeThemeConfirmed → apply theme, persist to config file
      OutcomeThemeCanceled → restore original theme
      OutcomeFileChosen → reveal path in tree, focus diff, load if changed
      OutcomeClosed → close overlay, resume normal mode
  → Manager.Compose() renders popup over background content
```

## Configuration System

**Precedence**: CLI flags > env vars > config file > built-in defaults

- **Config file**: `~/.config/revdiff/config` (INI format via go-flags IniParser)
- **Theme files**: `~/.config/revdiff/themes/` (auto-created on first run)
- **Keybindings**: `~/.config/revdiff/keybindings` (`map`/`unmap` format)
- **History**: `~/.config/revdiff/history/` (auto-save dir)

Theme precedence: `--theme` overwrites all 23 color fields + chroma-style, ignoring `--color-*`
flags or env vars. Applied via `applyTheme()` in `app/revdiff/themes.go` which directly overwrites
`opts.Colors.*` fields after `parseArgs()`.

Adding a new color requires changes in three places: `theme.go` colorKeys + options struct +
`colorFieldPtrs()` in `app/revdiff/themes.go`.

Theme ownership is split by concern: `app/theme` owns discovery/loading/installation via `Catalog`,
`app/ui` consumes a `ThemeCatalog` interface for selector/preview/apply, and `app/revdiff/themes.go` wires a
thin adapter composing `theme.Catalog` + config file persistence.

## Input Modes

Several mutually exclusive input sources, validated at parse time:

| Mode | Flag | Renderer | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| VCS diff (default) | `[base] [against]` | `Git` or `Hg` | Detects VCS, runs diff |
| Staged changes | `--staged` | `Git` or `Hg` | Cannot combine with refs |
| All tracked files | `--all-files` / `-A` | `DirectoryReader` | Git only, not with refs/staged/only |
| Single file(s) | `--only` / `-F` | `FileReader` | Not with include |
| Stdin (raw text) | `--stdin` | `StdinReader` | Sniff fails or returns `ErrNotUnifiedDiff` |
| Stdin (multi-file diff) | `--stdin` | `MultiFileStdinReader` | Sniffs the unified-diff signature |

`MultiFileStdinReader` parses each section via `parseUnifiedDiff`; any per-section parse error fails
the whole call, so the caller falls back to `StdinReader` for the entire input.

Filters stack: `--include` narrows first, then `--exclude` removes. Both wrap any renderer as
decorators.

## Design Decisions

**Single Model struct with split files** — bubbletea's architecture centers on one Model. Splitting
methods across files by concern keeps each file manageable while avoiding the complexity of multiple
coordinating models.

**Consumer-side interfaces** — all interfaces defined in `app/ui/model.go`, not in implementor
packages. Idiomatic Go pattern that keeps packages decoupled and makes the dependency direction
explicit.

**Factory closures for sidepane components** — `NewFileTree` and `ParseTOC` are factory closures,
not direct constructor calls, because they need runtime parameters from `main.go` that Model
shouldn't know about.

**Raw ANSI instead of lipgloss for inline elements** — lipgloss `Render()` emits `\033[0m` (full
reset) which breaks outer backgrounds. Elements rendered inside a lipgloss container (status bar
separators, cursor markers, annotation text) use raw ANSI sequences via the style sub-package.

**Overlay Outcome pattern** — overlays return `Outcome` values instead of directly modifying Model
state. Keeps overlay package independent from Model, makes side effects explicit and testable.

**Foreground-only syntax highlighting** — chroma output limited to foreground colors so diff line
backgrounds (add/remove/modify) from the style system are preserved without conflict.

**Loaded-file state object** — `diffLines`, `highlightedLines`, `intraRanges`, and related per-file
metadata are grouped into a single `loadedFileState` struct (`m.file`). This makes the
synchronization invariant explicit — all parallel arrays and derived data for the current file are
co-located rather than scattered across top-level Model fields.

**Model state sub-structs** — `Model` fields are grouped into named sub-structs (`cfg`, `layout`,
`file`, `modes`, `nav`, `search`, `annot`) by concern. Methods remain on `Model` — the sub-structs
make state ownership explicit without splitting into mini-models.
